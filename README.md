# Web Scraping Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to build a web application to scrape various websites for data related to Mars and display the information on an HTML page. Web scraping was done using Python through Jupyter Notebook. News Articles, images and facts were scraped from different sources. Notebooks were then converted to Python script files which were called through Flask functions.
